# Basic Practice Data Analysis

This is my practice for basic skill about data analysis.
Here is the tutorial.

[Week 1]
- Git (Version Control)  & EDA 
- Framework (Tensorflow & Pytorch)
- Algorithm

[week 2]
- Regression (Linear Regression, p-value, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, Logistic Regression, Confusion Matrix, AUROC)
- Optimization (MLE & MAP (Bayes Rule), Eigen Value Decomposition & Singular Value Decomposition, Linear & Quadratic Programming, Langrange multiplier method, Gradient Ascent & Descent Method)

[week 3]
- Neural Net Basic (XOR problem, Gradient Descent Method, Back propagation (chain-rule), Activation Function, MLP)
- NB (Conditional Independence) & DT (Entropy, Gini-Index, Greedy Method(Error Propagation), Information Gain) 
- Algorithm

[week 4]
- Unsupervised - Dimensionality Reduction : PCA (Eigen/Singular Value Decomposition), k-PCA, LLE (Opt Linear Weight > Opt Low dimension representation), MDS (Distance Matrix > Inner Product Matrix > Low dimension representation), Isomap (Distance Matrix is based on Graph Structure), LDA, T-SNE (t-distribution, KL Divergence)
- Unsupervised - Clustering : KNN (Distance-based (need standardization), Mahalanobis Distance (Covariance Matrix)), K-means, GMM (Expectation & Maximization, Multinomial Distribution, Multivariate Gaussian Distribution), DBSCAN

[week 5]
- SVM (Kernel-based method, KKT Condition & Dual Form & Hard-Margin, Soft-Margin) & SVR
- Time-Series : ARIMA, Prophet
- Algorithm

[week 6]
- Neural Net Advanced : Optimizer (SGD, Momentum, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adam), Dropout, Batch & Layer Normalization, Weight Decay, Learning Rate Scheduler, Skip-Connection, Callbacks, Label Smoothing, Gradient Clipping
- Ensemble : Random Forest (bootstrapping, OOB Error), Adaboosting (Sampling Weight Update) , Gradient Boosting (Fitting Residual) & Stacking

[week 7]
- Vision Basic (CNN)
- NLP Basic (NLP Task, Word Embedding, RNN & LSTM & GRU, Topic Modeling)
- Algorithm

[week 8]
- NLP Advanced (Contextual Embedding - Transformers)
- Vision Advanced

[week 9]
- Recommender system Basic
